<h1>Points Per Games</h1>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold">The Guardian - as is their perogative - changed their whole page structure for the new season, which meant a rewrite of the scraper.<br/> Things are working now, with the exception of the Scottish tables.</h3>
<h2>Available Tables</h2>

@foreach (var link in Model)
{
    var href = "/Tables/" + link.Key;

    <a href="@href">@link.Value</a><br>
}

<h2>Sorting</h2>
     Teams are sorted by points per game, then by the number of games played.
<br>
     This means if two teams have the same points per game, then the team which has played the fewer games is sorted higher.
<br>
     If both of those values are equal, teams are sorted by goal difference, and then by team name.
